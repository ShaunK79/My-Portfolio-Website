Please have a look at my personal portfolio - https://shaun-kriel.com

This was an exciting and challenging project to work on. I just wanted to get something out there to so I made use of bootstrap from my learning which made the process alot quicker however I did make alot of changes to suit me. There was plenty of additonal add ons that I thought was way too much especailly as I have just started so These were removed and I added my own personal styling. I am pretty pleased with the outcome and also learnt a tremendous amount - structuring in HTML. Styling, positioning, responsiveness and specificity. Although the Javascript was included it still gave me a perspective of how it works.
